1. Used create-react-app and tailwind.css
2. Mobile view is based on iphone 14 pro max screen width, havent fine tune.
3. Haven't touch on desktop view, so it will look kinda messy.
4. To do the responsive, in tailwind css, we have to write sm: or md: prefix before the utility class. Eg:// sm: text-3xl
5. Can refer to the tailwind.css documentation.
6. https://tailwindcss.com/docs/font-size
